# odin-recipes
This project is an Odin Project assignment that is a website that will consist of a main index page
and links to a few recipes. This will be a display of the current HTML skill that I have acquired.
# Review
I used the skills I learned which included: linking images and pages, constructing the correct boilerplate code, adding basic structure to my html files, and utilizing git commands in the CLI. Unfortunately, I forgot to take the time to do make proper commit messages at different steps of the project and was finished by the time that I realized.
